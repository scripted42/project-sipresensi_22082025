## Test 3: API Login Endpoint (Retest)
**Endpoint:** POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login
**Date:** 2025-08-20
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "nisn_nip_nik": "1001",
  "password": "admin"
}
```
**Result:** FAILED
**Response:** 404 Not Found
**Error:** 
```
Received HTML error page instead of JSON response:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <title>Not Found</title>
...
```
**Note:** The API endpoint is not found. This could be due to incorrect routing configuration or the API routes not being properly set up.

## Next Steps:
1. Check API routes configuration in Laravel
2. Verify that the auth controller and login method exist
3. Reset database with `php artisan migrate:fresh`
4. Document all test results in this file
