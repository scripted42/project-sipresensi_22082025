## Analysis: API Login Endpoint Issue

**Date:** 2025-08-20

**Findings:**
1. API routes have been properly defined in `routes/api.php`:
   ```php
   Route::prefix('auth')->group(function () {
       Route::post('/login', [AuthController::class, 'login']);
       Route::post('/logout', [AuthController::class, 'logout'])->middleware('auth:sanctum');
   });
   ```

2. AuthController exists and has a properly implemented login method in `app/Http/Controllers/API/AuthController.php`.

3. However, when testing the endpoint, we received a 404 Not Found error instead of the expected JSON response.

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
The issue is likely related to the database migration problems we encountered earlier:
- The migration failed with "SQLSTATE[42S01]: Base table or view already exists: 1050 Table 'users' already exists"
- This suggests that the database is in an inconsistent state
- Laravel might not be able to fully initialize the application due to database issues

**Next Steps:**
1. Reset database with `php artisan migrate:fresh`
2. Re-test API endpoints after database reset
3. Document all test results in this file
