# Scanner Implementation Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-22

### Added
- New `ExpoCameraScanner` component using `expo-camera` for QR code scanning
- Support for real device deployment (not just emulators)
- Flashlight toggle functionality
- Camera switching between front and back cameras
- Visual viewfinder with corner markers
- Rate limiting to prevent multiple scans
- Vibration feedback on successful scan
- Camera permission handling with settings redirect
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### Changed
- Replaced `expo-barcode-scanner` implementation with `expo-camera`
- Updated `StudentAttendanceScreen` to use the new scanner component
- Improved scanner UI with better visual feedback
- Enhanced documentation with detailed implementation guide

### Removed
- Old `RobustScanQRSection` component
- Dependency on `expo-barcode-scanner` (still listed in package.json for compatibility)

### Fixed
- Scanner not working on real devices issue
- Improved permission handling flow
- Better error messaging for users

## Implementation Details

### Why expo-camera?
The decision to switch to `expo-camera` was made because:
1. `expo-barcode-scanner` has limitations when running on real devices
2. `expo-camera` provides more reliable performance on physical devices
3. Better control over camera features like flashlight and camera switching
4. More consistent behavior across different device manufacturers

### Technical Improvements
1. **Real Device Support**: The new implementation works reliably on actual Android and iOS devices
2. **Better Permissions Handling**: More robust permission request and redirect flow
3. **Enhanced UI**: Improved visual feedback with clearer viewfinder and instructions
4. **Performance**: Optimized scanning algorithm with rate limiting
5. **User Experience**: Added vibration feedback and clearer error messages

### Migration Notes
Projects upgrading from the old `expo-barcode-scanner` implementation should:
1. Replace imports from `RobustScanQRSection` to `ExpoCameraScanner`
2. Ensure `expo-camera` is installed and properly configured
3. Test thoroughly on real devices before deployment
4. Update any custom styling to match the new component interface

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test on multiple Android and iOS devices
2. Verify camera permission flow works correctly
3. Test flashlight and camera switching functionality
4. Ensure QR codes are detected reliably in various lighting conditions
5. Verify error handling for edge cases (no camera access, etc.)

## Known Limitations
1. Some older devices may have limited camera feature support
2. Flashlight control depends on hardware capabilities
3. Camera switching requires device to have multiple cameras
4. Performance may vary on low-end devices
